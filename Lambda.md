## **What is AWS Lambda?**

*AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when*
*needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume -*
*there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend*
*service - all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the* 
*administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling,* 
*code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports.*

*You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table;*
*to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway; or invoke your code using API calls made using AWS SDKs. With* 
*these capabilities, you can use Lambda to easily build data processing triggers for AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB,* 
*process streaming data stored in Kinesis, or create your own back end that operates at AWS scale, performance, and security.*

*You can also build serverless applications composed of functions that are triggered by events and automatically deploy them using* 
*CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild. For more information, see AWS Lambda applications.*

## **Benefits**

### **NO SERVERS TO MANAGE**
*AWS Lambda automatically runs your code without requiring you to provision or manage servers. Just write the code and upload it to Lambda.*

### **CONTINUOUS SCALING**
*AWS Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger. Your code runs in parallel and processes* 
*each trigger individually, scaling precisely with the size of the workload.*

### **SUBSECOND METERING**
*With AWS Lambda, you are charged for every 100ms your code executes and the number of times your code is triggered. You pay only for the compute* 
*time you consume.*

### **CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE**
*With AWS Lambda, you can optimize your code execution time by choosing the right memory size for your function. You can also enable Provisioned* 
*Concurrency to keep your functions initialized and hyper-ready to respond within double digit milliseconds.*
